            Here at SOS we are driven by a passion to end the peer pressure we face on a daily basis, and to aid other students across the country by promoting a 
            system of accountability involving the parent and the teen. Our goal is to give us the upper hand the next time we are faced with the decision, the 
            decision that millions of teens face on a daily basis and to answer the global cry for help from millions of teens, just like us.</asp:Panel>
