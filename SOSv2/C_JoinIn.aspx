            By signing this contract with a parent or guardian, a commitment is born to stay drug-free. Once the contract is signed the student will 
            recive certain benefits specified by one's school administration and supporting companies. Also, the student will receive a drug test 
            that their parent/gaurdian is to administer when the parent/gauridan deems necessary. More importantly, an excuse was created for the 
            teen when faced with the decision to "take a hit" or stand up and say the one word that presents the biggest hurdle for almost half of 
            the twelfth graders in America... "No".</asp:Panel>
